				<div class="logTitle"> DEVLOG - The Future Is Dimly-Lit </div>
				<div class="logDate"> 03/17/24 </div>
				<p class="logContents"> i gotta make a devlog, i don't have anywhere to share my cool stuff now. god, i'm getting lots of ego again <br>
				if you haven't known, i'm making a zombie game inspired by g&b and some other games related to zombies or about zombies. survive the longest in an apocalyptic bordered-off city whilst trying to fend for your life against zombies until you eventually join them. when you do, you can bring down fellow survivors along with you. pretty cool, right? <br>
				<img src="shamblerwee.png"> <br>
				the basic stuff is down, like infection and stuff and some attacks and stuff. it's gonna be a long ride full of twists and turns, yadda yadda.
				anyways, more about the game concept, eh?!?! <br>
				<br>
				the shambler is your basic zombie, slow and stuff, not strong attacks but great in crowds. it has yellow eyes and a scratch and grab attack. <br>
				<br>
				the runner is like the fast zombie. very fast but incredibly weak attacks, usually for helping other zombies types. it has red eyes and a stun and pummel attack. <br>
				<br>
				the weeper is a hopefully complex class. you look almost exactly how you looked like when you were a survivor, with your normal animations and some of your items. but you can infect people. the goal? fool your survivors into thinking you're still one of them, and strike. in the first phase (fooling), you have a grab attack only. in the second phase, you have a scratch and pummel attack from the shambler and weeper, although they are incredibly weak. <br>
				<br>
				
				hopefully these classes go hand in hand with eachother so that teamwork is incredibly strong while also allowing a solo kinda thing for all classes. <Br>
				for the worrying part of the log, the only thing im worried about is burnout. this game sounds like a really good idea to me and i don't want to put it to waste. i even named this log DEVLOG in hopes that it gets somewhere, i'm that deep in. not to mention that i'm incredibly stupid when it comes to luau. i find myself asking very experienced and very cool people how to do specific stuff. and God, although CFrame is useful, i fucking hate it. all I can do is hope that i'll still work on this game, other people think it's cool and I'll improve myself along the way. <br>
				<br>
				what about you? do you like the game idea? is it cool? would you like to be friends with it? would you hold its hands? would you make a never-ending relationship filled with fun memories and experiences to write about?

			<div id=footer> This footer is like placeholder and stuff. This is the same copyright message used in my project, except this text isn't here! Wow! Think this looks familiar? That's because the text doesn't change for the different pages. Lame, but I can't hide any other stuff here. Don't forget to shrink the website to 800px or 600px width! Please! There's like 2 different formats because those are 2 types of devices, I think. I can't think of any other device other than a PC, tablet or phone that has a different width resolution. Take this explanation seriously! Also, be glad that this text is different. Before it was simply "blablabla this is mine not yours" something something. I can't remember because it was a placeholder anyways. At this point of writing I realized that the fake copyright isn't long enough to fill the entire footer. Oh no! I guess I have to add more filler. I would complain about something but complaining is petty and would probably get blackmailed. LOL. Can we use acronyms? This is a website, and websites are online. Can we use internet acronyms? I really hope this footer isnt paid too much attention. I'm doing this the long-winded way where instead of resizing the text to make it fit on the footer at the cost of it being readable, I'm typing everything out so that it fills the entire footer. I can't be bothered to add secret pages. The last time I did, they didn't affect the grade. Unless maybe I change my mind and this statement turns out to be false or something. Hey, it's almost filled now! Did you know the last part is the only remaining part of the placeholder footer? That's pretty neat! Okay, I have to say my goodbyes. Bye bye! Copyright and stuff!<br>
